# Library-Management-System-API
The Library Management System API is a web service built with Flask. It lets users handle books and members in a library. You can add, read, update, and delete both books and members. To keep things safe, it uses tokens for logging in. The API also has some extra features. You can search for books and see them in smaller groups.
